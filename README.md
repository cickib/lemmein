**BudapestFlatFinder project** - *Flat finding application*

The project is *heavily* in progress.

This application collects flats from different rental websites based on your requirements.
Displaying every flat in one integrated table that can be sorted and filtered by every column makes it easier to find your new home.

**Tech stack:**
* Java8/SpringBoot back-end
* PostgreSQL db + Hibernate
* Angular 1 front-end + traces of Thymeleaf & JQuery
